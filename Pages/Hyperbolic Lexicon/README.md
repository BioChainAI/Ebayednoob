# Hyperbolic Lexicon · SHD-CCP integration and a staged hyperbolic BERT front end

**Status: Phase 0 (analysis, spikes, preregistration). No model code yet.** The eleven claims L1–L11 are registered in
`PREREGISTRATION.md` and undecided.

Open [`index.html`](index.html) for the hub: the system map, the explainer library, the roadmap, the claims ledger
and the decisions. [`summary.html`](summary.html) is the whole analysis on one page.

## The question

What have we built, and what would SHD-CCP integration look like? How would a hyperbolic version of BERT-style
language pre-processing work for our 2D (H²) and 3D (H³) systems, and what are the alternatives? Could we grow
biochains of language pre-processing data as SHD-CCP chains, as BioChain-AI grows biochains? And which benchmarks would
help such a system develop?

## The answers in brief

1. **What we built is strong on exact geometry and integrity, and has nothing yet for language learning.**
   - *Have:* exact norm-5 quaternion addresses; an exact H³ tree to depth 28; hyperboloid tools; Merkle chains;
     the fence and guard; a Python-to-browser parity method.
   - *Missing:* no subword tokenizer, vocabulary, learned embeddings, encoder, gradients or language benchmarks
     exist in any of the four repositories.
   - *engram/1 is no token id:* it is letter-count parity (anagrams collide, numbers map to zero).
   - *PolyStep trains no encoder:* it is zeroth-order (48 parameters at most), and its "hyperbolic beats flat" claim
     C1 was refuted.
   - See `explainers/analysis.html`.
2. **SHD-CCP exists in three layers that disagree.** At least eight incompatible 64-bit layouts exist and every Form
   value is claimed, so integration means:
   - the Blackwell word only where we hand data to Owl Academy and BioChain-AI;
   - record kinds above the word;
   - golden vectors, and proposals instead of edits.
   The strongest link is mathematical: our tree's generators are the Lubotzky–Phillips–Sarnak p = 5 set, so SHD-CCP's
   planned X(5, q) overlay is a quotient of the tree our addresses already live on. See `explainers/shdccp.html`.
3. **A hyperbolic BERT is built in two stages.**
   - *Stage 1 is exact:* pinned Unicode normalisation; WordPiece; a training-free address for every WordNet synset;
     exact points in H³ and in a new exact H² tree; exact ranking.
   - *Stage 2 is the best-supported route in the literature:* a Euclidean encoder with the address as a hierarchy
     factor and a hyperbolic hierarchy head.
   - *Role of H² and H³:* they are far below language-model width, so they serve as factors, heads and views, not as
     the main embedding.
   - See `explainers/architecture.html`.
4. **Every alternative has a role:** main route, baseline, control, later, or rejected.
   - *Fully hyperbolic encoders:* need a GPU.
   - *Hyperbolic tokenization:* an open gap.
   - *Gradient-free training:* for heads only.
   - *engram/1 as an id:* rejected.
   - See `explainers/alternatives.html`.
5. **Language biochains: yes, as many 60 KB shards under an RFC 6962 manifest.** A single growing chain cannot work,
   because a whole lineage is capped at 60 KB. The design adds typed records, two privacy tiers, and a hardened,
   attested importer that closes what `verifyIntegrity` misses. See `explainers/biochains.html`.
6. **Benchmarks form a ladder.** Every hyperbolic claim gets a matched Euclidean control.

   | Stage | Benchmarks | Where it runs |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | 0 | Determinism and the tokenizer | here |
   | 1 | WordNet hierarchy reconstruction | here |
   | 2 | Lexical semantics | needs network access |
   | 3 | BabyLM pretraining with BLiMP | needs network access, or a GPU |
   | 4 | GLUE and MTEB | needs a GPU |

   Three compute tracks (browser, CPU, GPU) share one tokenizer record, the data roots, the seeds and the metric code,
   so their results compare. See `explainers/benchmarks.html` and `explainers/tracks.html`.

## What Phase 0 measured (spikes S1–S7)

| Spike | Found |
| --- | --- |
| S1 | Float64 ranking of exact H³ tree points first inverts an exactly strict order at depth 10 (straight paths) and 12 (random words); exact decoding never failed. |
| S2 | A new exact H² tree with t = 11/13 (τ = ln 12) decodes every random word at every depth to 28, at 1.28–2.38× the bits of H³. |
| S3 | On WordNet's verb forest the exact tree's graph-edge MAP is 0.6309: the fixed branching of 5 forces "virtual letters" that put siblings as close as parents. This fixes L6(c)'s prediction as refuted. |
| S4 | Lexicon shards equal Owl Academy's own biochains field for field (126/126). Owl's `verifyIntegrity` accepts records with leaves and root deleted, a crystal changed, or chainId altered; RFC 6962 proofs stay at 10–14 hashes. |
| S5 | X(5, q) for q = 13, 17, 29: 2,184, 4,896 and 12,180 vertices, girths 8, 8, 9, Ramanujan; SHD-CCP's Hurwitz product, halved, equals our tree's quaternions. |
| S6 | Node and Chromium are at Unicode 17.0, Python at 15.1; a pinned 15.1 table reproduces Python on every code point; a 20,520-case stress set. |
| S7 | BioChain-AI's ATTEST/1 signatures cross between WebCrypto and Python only through a padded P1363 ↔ DER conversion; verification costs about 0.2 ms. |

## Decisions

| # | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| D1 | A new folder that loads the shared cores unchanged by relative path |
| D2 | Exact first; learning in float64; learned tables stored as dyadic snaps |
| D3 | The octahedral H³ tree is the primary exact store; a new exact H² tree (t = 11/13) serves the 2D system; the float H² tree only draws |
| D4 | Token id, address and engram are separate; engram/1 is a compatibility checksum; V0 until V1 can be pinned |
| D5 | Normalisation on pinned Unicode 15.1 tables, failing closed; N1 is the fallback |
| D6 | The L3 address rule and the bijective 59/64-bit id |
| D7 | The Blackwell word only at the bridge; record kinds above the word |
| D8 | Shards of at most 60,000 bytes in unmodified `shdccp/2`; RFC 6962 manifests; two tiers |
| D9 | Authorities: the Python reference (exact claims); Owl's and BioChain's JavaScript (compatibility); the numpy trainer (embeddings) |
| D10 | The three tracks share the tokenizer record, data roots, generator, metric code, budgets and receipts |
| D11 | No model code before its claims are registered; PolyStep only for small heads |
| D12 | The other repositories are read only; their Python runs as `python3 -B -I` |

Open choices with defaults:
- **Network access:** widen it to huggingface.co, osf.io, zenodo.org, arxiv.org and aclanthology.org before
  Phase 4. Until then, Stages 0–1 run on WordNet, UD EWT and BLiMP from GitHub.
- **GPU track:** on your own hardware or a rented GPU, from Phase 7.
- **Kernel Form ID:** 0xA.
- **Publishing:** no shards to Firestore this round.
- **Proposals:** sent after Phase 3.

## Scope

- **What Phase 0 shows.** It analyses, measures and registers. It shows nothing about whether hyperbolic geometry
  helps a language model.
- **What Hyperbolic Oracles already found.** Its C1 ("hyperbolic beats flat" for PolyStep optimisation) was refuted.
  The literature finds clear gains only on explicit hierarchies, and modest or none on general NLP.
- **What this system bets on.** Representation of hierarchies in low dimensions, and certification: exactness,
  invertibility, and results identical across engines. Encoder-level gains are predicted small or null at this scale.
- **What one address means.** One address per synset is one sense, without context. Most `##` pieces have no synset
  and get orthographic addresses.
- **What exactness costs.** Exactness moves the precision cost of deep trees into BigInt (S1: ~139 bits per
  coordinate at depth 28); it does not remove it.

## How to check

```
node "Pages/Hyperbolic Lexicon/tests/all.cjs"
```

It runs:
- the shared cores' checks and Engram's parity and bridges;
- this folder's links and spike reruns;
- the site bar;
- the WordNet and EWT pins and the kernel check. These are reported as skipped, never passed, without the data cache
  or an SHD-CCP checkout.

Fetch the data once:

```
node "Pages/Hyperbolic Lexicon/reference/golden/make_wordnet_v1.cjs"
node "Pages/Hyperbolic Lexicon/reference/golden/make_ewt_v1.cjs"
```
